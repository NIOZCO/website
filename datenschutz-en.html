<h2 id="kontaktdaten-verantwortlicher">2. Contact details of the controller and for data protection inquiries</h2>

<h2 id="online-auftritte">3. Data processing in connection with my online presence</h2>
<h3 id="soziale-medien">3.1 Presence on social media</h3>
<h4>Data processing in connection with my presence on Instagram</h4>
<p>I use the platform and services of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Merrion Road, Dublin 4, D04 X2K5, Ireland &#40;hereinafter “Meta”&#41; for the information I publish. If you decide to use my pages on Meta services, you do so on your own responsibility. This applies in particular to the use of interactive features &#40;e.g. commenting or rating&#41;. I have no influence on the type and scope of data that Meta collects and processes. As a rule, when you use my pages on Meta, the IP address assigned to your device is transmitted to Meta. According to Meta, this IP address is anonymized &#40;for IP addresses from Germany&#41; and deleted after 90 days. Meta also stores information about your device. This information is used to provide me, as the page operator, with statistical information.</p>
<p>Meta also provides me with statistical data for my pages. These are aggregated data through which I can gain insights into how users interact with my page and which enable me to present my offer in an optimized manner and ensure effective communication with users. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR, whereby my legitimate interest arises from the aforementioned purposes. The data collected about you in this context is processed by Meta and may be transmitted to countries outside the European Union. Information on the transfer of European data to third countries by Meta, including the Instagram platform, can be found here: <a class="ltp" href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum</a></p>
<p>Further information on data protection at Meta and in particular on how you can object to processing, or manage or delete the information stored about you, can be found in Meta’s privacy policies: <a class="ltp" href="https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/</a></p>
<p>If you are logged in to Meta services, a cookie containing your identifier is stored on your device. This enables Meta to track that you have visited my page and how you have used it. This also applies to all other Meta pages. Meta can also assign your visits to these websites to your Meta profile. On the basis of this data, Meta can provide content or advertising tailored to you. If you wish to avoid this, you can log out of Meta or deactivate the “stay logged in” function and delete the cookies stored on your device. In this way, Meta information that can directly identify you will be deleted. You can then use my pages on Meta without your Meta identifier being disclosed. If you wish to use interactive features on the page &#40;e.g. Like, Comment and Messages&#41;, a Meta login window will appear. Once you log in, Meta can again associate you with your profile.</p>
<p>Where I, as the provider of my pages on Meta, process personal data exclusively myself, for example if you contact me regarding my products or give me your consent for this, the collection, processing and use of your data is carried out for the purpose of answering your inquiry or providing the service you have requested. The legal bases for processing are Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. a GDPR &#40;consent&#41;, Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. b GDPR and Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>As the provider of my pages on Meta, I do not otherwise collect or process any data from your use of my service.</p>
<h4>Data processing in connection with my presence on YouTube</h4>
<p>I operate a YouTube channel in order to share my content and services via the YouTube platform, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland &#40;hereinafter “YouTube”&#41;. When you visit my YouTube channel or interact with my videos, various data about you is collected and processed by YouTube. YouTube collects data about your use of the platform, such as which videos you watch, the duration of your use and your interactions &#40;e.g. likes, comments&#41;. YouTube uses this data, among other things, to provide and improve the service, to personalize advertising, and to analyze your usage. I have no influence on this data processing by YouTube.</p>
<p>I use the statistics and reports provided by YouTube to gain insights into user behavior on my channel and to better tailor my content to the interests of viewers. In addition, I process your data in order to respond to inquiries and communicate with you if you contact me via YouTube. The processing of your data by me is based on my legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR. My legitimate interest is to analyze the success of my content and provide you with the best possible communication.</p>
<p>Further information on data processing by YouTube can be found in YouTube’s privacy policy: <a class="ltp" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
<h3 id="zahlungsdienstleister">3.2 Use of payment service providers</h3>
<p>I am currently not using any payment service providers. Should this change in the future, I will of course inform you transparently and ensure that your personal data is protected in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations.</p>
<h2 id="website-nutzung">4. Data processing when using my website</h2>
<p>When you access my website, your internet browser automatically transmits the following data to my web server for technical reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Date and time of the server request</li>
<li>URL of the requested file</li>
<li>Transferred data volume</li>
<li>Operating system</li>
<li>Information on the browser type and version used</li>
<li>Name of the internet service provider</li>
<li>Website from which this website was accessed</li>
<li>Page visited on my website</li>
</ul>
<p>The collection, processing and use of the above data is carried out for the purpose of enabling the use and delivery of my website. Further purposes are the security of my IT systems and technical administration. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR, whereby my legitimate interest arises from the purposes mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you decide to use my contact form, your information will be used exclusively for the purpose of processing your inquiry and performing any services you may request via this form. I only collect and process additional or other personal data if you use certain services and I require your data for this purpose, or if you have given me your explicit consent, for example by completing a corresponding form, sending me an email, commissioning services or sending inquiries to me. The legal bases for processing are Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. b GDPR and Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR.</p>
<h3>Essential cookies and services required for website operation</h3>
<p>Essential cookies are required to ensure the basic functions of my website and its operation. Processing is carried out on the basis of my legitimate interest in the basic provision of my website. The legal basis is Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR. Without these cookies, my website cannot function properly. These cookies can only be disabled in the browser settings.</p>
<h3>Data processing in connection with the cookie management tool</h3>
<p>This website does not use a cookie consent tool because no cookies are in use.</p>
<h2 id="datenweitergabe">5. Data transfer to third parties and external recipients</h2>
<p>In certain cases, I am legally obliged to transfer data to a requesting state authority, for example under national legal provisions. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. c GDPR. When engaging service providers within the framework of data processing on my behalf, I comply with the data protection requirements in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR and Art. 44 et seq. GDPR.</p>
<p>In all other respects, I only transfer data to third parties if you have explicitly consented to this, if the transfer is clearly necessary for the performance of a service requested by you &#40;e.g. engagement of a shipping service provider&#41;, or if the transfer is required by law.</p>
<p>In the event that personal data is transferred to countries outside the EU or EEA, I take all necessary steps to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect your personal data in accordance with data protection regulations, for example by applying the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission.</p>
<h2 id="kommunikation-marketing">6. Use of data for communication and marketing</h2>
<h3>Surveys and advertising for similar products</h3>
<p>To ensure that my service meets your needs, I may use your email address, which you provide in the course of an inquiry, order or in connection with the use of my free services, for customer satisfaction surveys. As a customer, I may also send you advertising for similar products by email without your prior consent, where such products are similar to services you have previously ordered from me or used in the past. The legal basis for processing is my legitimate interest in improving my services &#40;Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR&#41;.</p>
<p>You may object to the future use of your email address at any time by sending a message to the contact details provided above or, in the case of a newsletter, by using the unsubscribe link contained therein.</p>
<h2 id="ip-management">7. Use of Impressum-Privatschutz &#40;IP management&#41;</h2>
<p>I use the services of IMPRESSUM-PRIVATSCHUTZ GmbH, Ludwig-Erhard-Str. 18, 20459 Hamburg, for managing postal mail sent to me. This service provider offers a secure and reliable postal address for my project &#40;e.g. legal notice, privacy policy, cancellation policy and possibly other sections&#41;. This also constitutes my legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. f GDPR. I have concluded a data processing agreement with Impressum-Privatschutz and fully comply with the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using this service. Further information on data protection at Impressum-Privatschutz GmbH can be found here: <a class="ltp" href="https://impressum-privatschutz.de/datenschutzerklaerung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://impressum-privatschutz.de/datenschutzerklaerung/</a></p>
<h2 id="speicherdauer">8. Storage period of the data</h2>
<p>I store personal data until you withdraw your consent or until the data is no longer required to fulfil my business interests or to provide the services you have requested, or where storage is no longer legally required.</p>
<h2 id="datensicherheit">9. Data security</h2>
<p>I place great importance on the protection of your personal data and have therefore implemented technical and organizational measures &#40;TOMs&#41; to ensure an appropriate level of protection in accordance with legal requirements, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation &#40;GDPR&#41;. These measures are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data I process and to protect it from unauthorized access, loss, destruction or manipulation.</p>
<p>The technical and organizational measures are adjusted where necessary to reflect the state of the art in order to continue to ensure the protection of your data.</p>
<h2 id="rechte-betroffene">10. Your rights as a data subject</h2>
<p>You have the right at any time to obtain information free of charge about the purpose, scope, origin and recipients of the personal data stored about you &#40;Art. 15 GDPR&#41;. You also have the right to request the rectification of inaccurate or incomplete data &#40;Art. 16 GDPR&#41;.</p>
<p>In accordance with data protection regulations, you also have the right to have your personal data erased, provided the conditions of Art. 17 GDPR are met &#40;right to be forgotten&#41;, as well as the right to restrict the processing of your personal data pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR. In addition, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data &#40;Art. 21 GDPR&#41; where such processing is based on Art. 6 &#40;1&#41; lit. e or f GDPR. This applies in particular to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You also have the right to data portability, i.e. you may receive the personal data you have provided to me in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format or request that this data be transmitted to another controller, provided that the conditions of Art. 20 GDPR are met.</p>
<p>If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates data protection regulations or that your rights have otherwise been infringed, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future, for example by sending an informal message by email or in writing to the contact details provided above &#40;Art. 7 &#40;3&#41; GDPR&#41;. The lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of your consent up to the time of withdrawal remains unaffected.</p>
