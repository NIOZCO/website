         <h1>Information</h1>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a creative hobby artist and developer who enjoys working on drawings, worldbuilding, small programs and digital projects.</p>
        <p>This website is my personal space to let my own ideas, worlds and projects gradually grow - without time pressure and purely for the joy of creating.</p>
        <p>I work independently, on a small scale and without commercial intent. All content is created in my free time - as a long-term passion project.</p>
        <hr class="invi">
        <h3>About this website</h3>
        <p>This website was programmed by myself and is constantly being improved.</p>
        <p>It serves as a central hub for my projects - including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>drawings and illustrations</p></li>
            <li><p>my own fantasy world</p></li>
            <li><p>small software and web projects</p></li>
            <li><p>personal creative experiments</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>New content will appear gradually - as soon as it is ready.</p>
        <hr class="invi">
        <h3>Transparency, sources and licenses</h3>
        <p>It is important to me to work openly and transparently.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the following applies to all content on this website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Sources are always indicated when I use third-party information</p></li>
            <li><p>Licenses are correctly stated when using third-party material</p></li>
            <li><p>My own works are clearly marked</p></li>
            <li><p>AI-generated content is clearly labeled &#40;if applicable&#41;</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If content appears on external platforms, their guidelines also apply.</p>
        <hr class="invi">
        <h3>Note on AI usage</h3>
        <p>In a time when AI can generate texts, images and music at the push of a button, I consciously choose a different path.</p>
        <p>I only use artificial intelligence as support - never as a replacement for creative work.</p>
        <p>My projects are created mainly through my own work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>drawings - traditional or digital</p></li>
            <li><p>self-programmed tools and websites</p></li>
            <li><p>my own designs and ideas</p></li>
            <li><p>image editing without AI filters</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI may occasionally assist, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>when thinking about alternatives</p></li>
            <li><p>for brainstorming</p></li>
            <li><p>for technical support</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, the creative result always comes from me - or is created in human collaboration.</p>
        <p>If AI was involved in content creation, this will be clearly indicated.</p>
        <hr class="invi">
        <h3>Why hardly any AI?</h3>
        <p>AI does not create content from nothing - it is based on existing works, data and ideas. Because of this, many AI-generated results are legally and ethically difficult to classify and are often not clearly “original works”.</p>
        <p>I therefore prefer to create my content myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>personally</p></li>
            <li><p>creatively</p></li>
            <li><p>with traceable protection</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This way, my projects retain their own unique character.</p>
